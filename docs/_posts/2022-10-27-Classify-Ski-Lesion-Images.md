According to The Skin Cancer Foundation, 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70 and more than 2 people die of skin cancer in the U.S. every hour. Worldwide, melanoma of skin is the 17th most common form of cancer. However, because non-melanoma skin cancer is often excluded from official statistics, it is significantly under-reported. In Brazil, according to the Brazilian Cancer Institute (INCA), skin cancer accounts for 33% of all cancer diagnoses in the country. Developing an algorithm to distinguish skin cancer from other lesions would allow communities to make the best use of limited healthcare resources.

In this lab, you will use Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy a classification model based on the PAD-UFES-20 skin lesion dataset.
