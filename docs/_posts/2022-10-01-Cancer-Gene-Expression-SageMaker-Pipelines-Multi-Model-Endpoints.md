In the context of survival analysis for cancer, a common approach is to analyze gene signatures, and to predict the survival of patients based on the gene expression signatures.

In this blog post, we show how you can leverage SageMaker Pipelines and SageMaker MultiModel Endpoints to build and deploy many such models.
