This workshop presents an AWS solution by running open source MONAI label on EC2 virtual machine with autoscaling, which has been mounted to the same Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume shared with Amazon Sagemaker Studio notebook instances.

Through the common file share, clinicians and data scientists can collaborate on the same data sets through different tools that they are familiar with.

Amazon AppStream 2.0 is used to stream an image computing platform, named 3D Slicer for interactive medical image annotation for clinicians.
