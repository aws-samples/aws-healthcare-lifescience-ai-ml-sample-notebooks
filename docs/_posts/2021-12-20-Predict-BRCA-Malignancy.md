For this model, we will build, train and deploy a Multi-layer Perceptron using the sklearn library. This is a breast cancer diagnoses dataset, where, for each sample, the sample is diagnosed as "Benign" or "Malignant". For each sample, a number of features are given as well. The source of the dataset is the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
