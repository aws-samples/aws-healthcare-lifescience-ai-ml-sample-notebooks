Researchers must stay up-to-date on their fields of interest. However, it's difficult to keep track of the large number of journals, whitepapers, and research pre-prints generated in many areas. In response, many research groups have turned to AI/ML tools to summarize and classify new documents.

In this workshop, we'll use several AWS AI/ML services to process scientific documents from the NIH NCBI PMC Article Dataset on the Registry of Open Data. This is a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal article at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine.
