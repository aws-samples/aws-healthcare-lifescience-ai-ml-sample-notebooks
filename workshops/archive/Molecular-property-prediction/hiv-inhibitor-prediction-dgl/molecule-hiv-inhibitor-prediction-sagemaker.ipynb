    "### Why is Deep Learning Useful for Analyzing Biological Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with classical network analysis, you may have encountered concepts such as the [betweenness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality), [degree centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Degree_centrality), or [random walk with restart](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-walks-with-restart-explained-77c3fe216bca). These methods are useful for calculating properties of nodes, analyzing networks, or grouping disease [genes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18371930/). However, these methods are **transductive,** which means that they can only generate features for a particular graph. They cannot predict edges, classify graphs, or perform other tasks where multiple graphs are needed. See [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216) paper for further discussion of this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A quick note on nomenclature: we use the term “graphs\" to refer to biological networks; we reserve the term \"network\" for a neural network. Although it is common in the computational biology field to refer to biological graphs as networks, in the deep learning field, \"network\" refers almost exclusively to a neural network).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Convolution neural networks](https://www.d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-neural-networks/index.html), commonly used in computer vision, are also useful for analyzing graphs. Convolutions allow for **inductive** learning, whereby features are learned for different graph topologies. These convolutions transform the underlying information in the graph nodes and edges. While a single convolutional layer is generally not sufficient for most tasks, deep graph convolutional neural networks can perform graph prediction (i.e., predict the class of a network), link prediction (predict missing edges in a network), and other tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models can also incorporate different edge types as well as external information about edges and nodes. This makes deep learning an attractive approach for analyzing and making predictions about complex graphs. Biological networks are frequently very heterogeneous and include diverse data types such as metabolic, biophysical, proteomic and functional assays, and information about gene regulatory networks. For example, [this](https://www.amazon.science/blog/amazon-web-services-open-sources-biological-knowledge-graph-to-fight-covid-19) blog post shows how a knowledge graph with diverse node and edge types can predict drug repurposing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While scientists can create their own convolutional layers, deep learning researchers have already built many convolutions and architectures that have proven useful in many applications. For example, [GraphSage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf) can predict protein-protein interactions. Another commonly used approach is [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10903.pdf) (GAT).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more details of deep graph learning and how it can help analyze biological data, see [this](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/22/2/1515/5964185) review paper. You may also find [this](http://snap.stanford.edu/deepnetbio-ismb/) tutorial useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Deep Graph Library (DGL) and When Should You Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Graph Library (DGL) allows researches and developers to easily and quickly apply deep graph learning approaches to their data by abstracting away much of the difficult deep learning work and code. The DGL library comes with a number of prebuilt layers, including [GraphSage convolutions](https://docs.dgl.ai/generated/dgl.nn.pytorch.conv.SAGEConv.html#dgl.nn.pytorch.conv.SAGEConv), [GATs](https://docs.dgl.ai/generated/dgl.nn.pytorch.conv.GATConv.html#dgl.nn.pytorch.conv.GATConv), and [others](https://docs.dgl.ai/api/python/nn-pytorch.html). Users have have the flexibility to create their own layers and architectures as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The [DGL-LifeScience](https://lifesci.dgl.ai/index.html) Python package provides an even further abstraction of DGL, so that computational biologists, biochemists, and bioinformaticians who wish to leverage deep graph methods can easily do so for certain common use cases and performing common operations in the context of analyzing small and large molecules. If you want to learn more about how to use the DGL library, we recommend getting started with [this](https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.6.x/guide/graph.html) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook trains multiple graph neural network models using Deep Graph Library and deploys them using Amazon SageMaker, a comprehensive and fully-managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. "
