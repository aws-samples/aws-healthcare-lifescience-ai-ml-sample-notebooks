    "1. Use search_pmc_tool with rerank=\"referenced_by\", max_results to 200-500, and max_records to 20-50 to find highly-cited papers. Search broadly first, then narrow down. Use temporal filters like \"last 5 years\"[dp] for recent work. \n",
    "2. Use read_pmc_tool on the 1-2 most relevant articles from your search results to gain a better understanding of the space. Focus on highly-cited papers and reviews.\n",
    "3. Extract and summarize the most relevant clinical findings.\n",
    "4. Return structured, well-cited information with PMCID references.\n",
    "5. Return URL links associated with PMCID references\n",
    "\n",
    "Key guidelines:\n",
    "- Always use rerank=\"referenced_by\" in searches to prioritize influential papers.\n",
    "- Limit searches to 20-50 articles for focused analysis.\n",
    "- Select articles strategically based on citation count and relevance.\n",
