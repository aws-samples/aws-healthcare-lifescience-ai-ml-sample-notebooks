# Getting Started with Strands Agents

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of Strands Agents and get you up and running with your first agent.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- AWS account configured with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Access to the Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.7 Sonnet models in Amazon Bedrock

## Installation

Install Strands Agents and the tools package using pip:

```bash
pip install strands-agents strands-agents-tools
```

## Basic Concepts

Strands Agents is a framework for building AI agents that can interact with AWS services and perform complex tasks. The key components are:

1. **Agent**: The core component that manages the conversation and orchestrates tools
2. **Model**: The underlying LLM (Large Language Model) that powers the agent
3. **Tools**: Functions that the agent can use to perform specific tasks
4. **Sessions and State**: Mechanisms for maintaining conversation history and agent state across interactions
5. **Agent Loop**: The process flow of how agents receive input, process it, and generate responses
6. **Context Management**: How agents maintain and manage conversation context, including memory and retrieval

## Quick Start Guide

This folder contains a getting-started notebook and a simple usecase to help you get started:
