For many animals, too, tastes and smells are evocative and play a crucial role in finding food, allowing them to build on past successes and to learn how to find their next meal.\n",

Then later they'll seek out the same or similar scents. To succeed in the wild, they must be able to distinguish relevant scents at varying concentrations, and within complex milieus of other scents. But to find food in varied conditions and adapt to new situations, they also have to generalize from past experience.\n"

      "White Collar Proteins Help Fungi Do It in the Dark \n",
      "Light inhibits mating and haploid fruiting of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, but the mechanisms involved were unknown. Two genes controlling light responses were discovered through candidate gene and insertional mutagenesis approaches. Deletion of candidate genes encoding a predicted opsin or phytochrome had no effect on mating, while strains mutated in the white collar 1 homolog gene BWC1 mated equally well in the light or the dark. The predicted Bwc1 protein shares identity with Neurospora crassa WC-1, but lacks the zinc finger DNA binding domain. BWC1 regulates cell fusion and repression of hyphal development after fusion in response to blue light. In addition, bwc1 mutant strains are hypersensitive to ultraviolet light. To identify other components required for responses to light, a novel self-fertile haploid strain was created and subjected to Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis. One UV-sensitive mutant that filaments equally well in the light and the dark was identified and found to have an insertion in the BWC2 gene, whose product is structurally similar to N. crassa WC-2. The C. neoformans Bwc1 and Bwc2 proteins interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Deletion of BWC1 or BWC2 reduces the virulence of C. neoformans in a murine model of infection; the Bwc1-Bwc2 system thus represents a novel protein complex that influences both development and virulence in a pathogenic fungus. These results demonstrate that a role for blue/UV light in controlling development is an ancient process that predates the divergence of the fungi into the ascomycete and basidiomycete phyla.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Light is the fundamental energy source for life on earth and as such is a major environmental signal for organisms from all kingdoms of life. In the fungal kingdom, light can regulate growth, the direction of growth, asexual and sexual reproduction, and pigment formation, all of which are important aspects for the survival and dissemination of fungal species. These processes have negative implications to many aspects of human life, as the uncontrolled proliferation of fungi can lead to devastating plant disease, mold, and human disease. On the other hand, fungi are essential for recycling nutrients in the environment, in mycorrhizal interactions with plants, and as a source of food and pharmaceutical metabolites for humans. Understanding the role of environmental signals in fungal development is vital to increase the benefits and decrease the costs that fungi present. Despite the importance of light to fungal development, much has yet to be determined to illuminate the mechanisms fungi use to perceive and respond to light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effects of light have been investigated in model fungal species. While spectral analyses and the morphological effects of light have been well characterized in genera such as Coprinus (a basidiomycete) or Phycomyces (a zygomycete), at the molecular level Neurospora crassa (an ascomycete) is best understood based on the functions of the white collar (wc-1 and wc-2) genes in light sensing [1,2,3]. In N. crassa, blue light regulates induction of carotenoid pigment production, protoperithecia (sexual fruiting body) formation and phototropism of perithecial beaks, and circadian rhythm, all of which are abolished by mutations in wc-1 or wc-2 [4]. These two genes encode proteins with several conserved domains, including a zinc finger DNA binding domain found in both proteins [5,6,7]. The two proteins physically interact through PAS (conserved in Per, Arnt, Sim proteins) domains [8,9,10]. The WC-1 protein functions as the blue light receptor through a specialized PAS domain responsible for sensing light, oxygen, and voltage in other proteins (LOV domain), and, together with WC-2, acts as a transcription factor. The WC-1 protein interacts with a flavin chromophore [flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] to function as the blue light receptor [11,12]. A small protein, VIVID, also perceives blue light through a LOV domain and modulates N. crassa sensitivity to light [13]. N. crassa has an additional four candidate photoactive protein homologs whose functions in photoperception remain elusive [14,15].\n",
      "\n",
      "We set out to identify genes involved in the process by which light inhibits mating of the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans. In nature, cryptococcal varieties are associated with bird excreta, soil, tree hollows, and even caves [16,17]. Thus, the light stimuli studied under laboratory conditions are highly relevant to the varying light signals the fungus experiences in the wild. C. neoformans exists as a haploid yeast with two bipolar mating types (a and α). MATa and MATα cells fuse to form a dikaryotic hypha that terminates in a basidium in which nuclear fusion and meiosis occur, producing four long chains of haploid basidiospores by mitosis and budding. A similar process, known as haploid or monokaryotic fruiting, can occur with only one mating partner that also gives rise to filaments that terminate in basidium-like structures and produce short spore chains. Spores have been implicated as an infectious propagule, further underscoring the importance of understanding the regulatory processes governing basidiospore production [18,19]. Mating and fruiting are controlled in the laboratory by stimuli such as the presence of potential mating partners (via pheromone signaling), nutrient limitation, desiccation, temperature, and light [19]. Many aspects of the transduction pathways for these signals have been elucidated, particularly in response to pheromones and nutrient limitation [20], but no components of light signaling had been reported to date for this important human pathogen. We identify here two genes required for C. neoformans responses to light, and demonstrate their role in blue light regulation of development and sensitivity to UV light, and their requirement for full virulence of this pathogen in a mammalian host.\n",

      "Mating and fruiting of C. neoformans can be variable during culturing. Previous work in our laboratory and others has endeavored to find environmental factors that lead to this variation. One factor identified was light; cultures wrapped in aluminum foil exhibited enhanced mating and haploid fruiting compared to cultures in the light [19,21]. Our assays used cardboard containers in which 9-cm2 holes were excised from the lid and overlaid with aluminum foil or clear plastic wrap. Under these conditions, light inhibited both mating and haploid fruiting of C. neoformans, thereby ruling out any effects of plate-sealing on CO2 levels or desiccation (Figure 1A and 1B).\n",
