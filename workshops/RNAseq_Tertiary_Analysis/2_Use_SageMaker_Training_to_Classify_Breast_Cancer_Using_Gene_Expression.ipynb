    "In notebook 1 of this series, we demonstrated using RNAseq data to predict HER2 status using the compute resources on the notebook server. However, using notebook server resources to process large amounts of data or train complex models is generally not a good idea. It's possible to scale up your notebook server, but any time you spend on non-compute intensive tasks (i.e. most of your time) will be wasted. A better idea is to run your notebook on a small server and submit compute-intensive tasks to independent jobs. SageMaker provides managed services for running data processing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning jobs. In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to leverage these services to optimize the performance and cost of our tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll demonstrate two best practices: **Jobs** and **Experiments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These best practices play a key role in the **Prepare Data** and **Model Development** phases of the Machine Learning Lifecycle. For more information, please refer to the [Machine Learning Best Practices in Healthcare and Life Sciences Whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/ML-best-practices-health-science.pdf?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card).\n",

    "Machine learning is an iterative process that requires experimenting with various combinations of data, algorithms, and parameters, while observing their impact on model accuracy. The iterative nature of ML experimentation results in numerous model training runs and versions, making it challenging to track the best performing models and their configurations. The complexity of managing and comparing iterative training runs increases with generative artificial intelligence (generative AI), where experimentation involves not only fine-tuning models but also exploring creative and diverse outputs. Researchers must adjust hyperparameters, select suitable model architectures, and curate diverse datasets to optimize both the quality and creativity of the generated content. Evaluating generative AI models requires both quantitative and qualitative metrics, adding another layer of complexity to the experimentation process.\n",

There are few limitations on what kinds of code and operations you can run, and only a minimal contract:  input and output data must be placed in specified directories.  If this is done, SageMaker Processing automatically loads the input data from S3 and uploads transformed data back to S3 when the job is complete.\n",
